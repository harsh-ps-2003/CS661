# CS661 Course Project

Refer to [Proposal](https://hello.iitk.ac.in/manage/cs661sem32425/assignment_answers/Group12_Project%20Proposal_5715b2a0-f2db-4b6f-a1c4-3e686139ff04.pdf) for details. This repository is for technical implementation.

### Points to remember :

If I see your work is trivial, insufficient, and does not meet the quality bar during the final presentation, you will not get a good grade for the project

* ⁠You will build a visual-analytics interface/software to solve a problem from an application domain.
* ⁠⁠You are expected to have knowledge about your domain of application and the tasks you have picked must reflect that.
* ⁠Your tasks should be meaningful, and you should be able to explain why you are doing something.
* ⁠You should be able to tell a coherent story about your data through your visualization interface. ⁠Random set of plots will not help. You need to justify why you picked certain type of plots.
* ⁠You are expected to show meaningful patterns from your data through your interface.
*⁠ ⁠Since this is a visualization focused course, so even if you do a very sophisticated modeling, your visualization interface still should be the main focus for grading. How you are presenting your results will matter
* You are expected to write a comprehensive report of your work that describes the details of the methodologies and visualization techniques that you have used
* ⁠You should justify your design choices for your interface, such as: Why a bar chart and a not a pie chart!


* ⁠Grading will be done on your overall idea + quality of work, presentation, and report
* ⁠Total marks: 300
* ⁠Overall quality: 100
* ⁠Presentation + Q&A: 100 (individual) • Report: 100 (group)


*Presentation Slot booked on 13 th July (Sunday) - 11:40am to 12:00pm*
